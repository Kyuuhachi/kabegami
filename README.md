# Kabegami

This is essentially a rewrite of an old [gist](https://gist.github.com/Kyuuhachi/f74e149403e5c1f92006158f09108a78) of mine, rewritten to reduce latency and to be independent of any particular window manager (only tested with i3 however). It currently does not support multiple monitors, as I only own a single monitor.
